# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a premium, Apple-level UI component that displays recent vehicle check-ins in a modern automotive workshop management system. The component must embody Apple's design philosophy of clarity, depth, and deference while providing essential information at a glance with elegant microinteractions and adaptive theming.
