# Recent Records Premium Redesign - Spec

## Overview

This spec defines a complete ground-up redesign of the "Registros Recentes" (Recent Records) section with Apple-level premium quality. This is not an incremental improvement but a total reconstruction of the UI/UX layer.

## Design Philosophy

The redesign embodies three core principles:

1. **Clarity**: Information hierarchy through typography, spacing, and color
2. **Depth**: Layered surfaces with glassmorphism and natural shadows
3. **Deference**: Interface stays out of the way, content takes center stage

## Key Features

### Visual Design
- 20-24px border radius for soft, premium feel
- Glassmorphism with 8-16px backdrop blur
- Multi-layer shadows (12-32px blur)
- Subtle gradients and translucent surfaces
- Apple easing (cubic-bezier 0.2, 0.9, 0.2, 1)

### User Experience
- Intelligent grouping by date (Hoje, Ontem, Ãšltimos 7 dias, Mais antigos)
- Advanced search with fuzzy matching and highlighting
- Multi-criteria filtering (status, type, period)
- Bulk selection and batch operations
- Quick actions and contextual menus
- Preview panel with detailed information
- Mobile swipe gestures

### Technical Excellence
- Virtualization for lists > 30 items
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Dark mode with smooth transitions
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
- Responsive design (desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Performance budget < 25KB gzipped
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Getting Started

### For Implementation

1. Read [requirements.md](./requirements.md) to understand user needs
2. Review [design.md](./design.md) for technical specifications
3. Follow [tasks.md](./tasks.md) sequentially for implementation
4. Start with task 1 (Setup) and work incrementally

### For Review

1. Check requirements against business needs
2. Validate design decisions and visual specifications
3. Review task breakdown for completeness
4. Provide feedback before implementation begins

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy behind feature flag
2. **Phase 2**: A/B test with 10% of users
3. **Phase 3**: Gradual rollout to 50%
4. **Phase 4**: Full rollout with fallback
5. **Phase 5**: Remove old component after 2 weeks

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered:
1. Disable feature flag immediately
2. Investigate and fix in development
3. Deploy hotfix with additional tests
4. Re-enable for gradual rollout
