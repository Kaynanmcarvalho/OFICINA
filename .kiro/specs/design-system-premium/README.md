# Premium Design System - Specification

## Overview

This specification defines a comprehensive premium design system for the workshop management ERP, inspired by Apple's design principles. The system provides a modern, accessible, and high-fidelity interface with reusable components, design tokens, and a clear migration strategy.

## Design Philosophy

- **Clarity**: Typography and visual hierarchy guide users
- **Deference**: Interface defers to content with subtle depth
- **Depth**: Layering and motion provide hierarchy
- **Consistency**: Reusable patterns ensure predictability
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance for all users

## Key Features

### Design Token System
- 6 color palettes with 10-step scales (50-900)
- Complete typography system (SF Pro / Inter)
- Modular 4px-based spacing
- Elevation system with glass effects
- Standardized animation timings

### Component Library
- **Navigation**: Premium Navbar, Sidebar with responsive behavior
- **Data Display**: DashboardCard, DataTable with virtualization, AlertCenter
- **Forms**: Complete form controls (Input, Select, DatePicker, masked inputs)
- **Overlays**: Modal, Drawer with animations
- **Widgets**: Weather widget with forecasts

### Theme System
- Full light/dark mode support
- Glass morphism effects
- Smooth theme transitions
- Custom primary color support
- User preference persistence

### Performance
- Lighthouse score >= 80 (desktop), >= 60 (mobile)
- Bundle size < 5KB gzip per component
- Critical CSS extraction
- Lazy loading for non-critical assets

### Accessibility
- WCAG AA compliance
- Complete keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- 44x44px touch targets on mobile

```

## Quick Start

### For Product Managers
1. Read `requirements.md` to understand what we're building
2. Review `migration-plan.md` for timeline and phases
3. Check `acceptance-checklist.md` for success criteria

### For Designers
1. Review `design.md` for design decisions and patterns
2. Check design tokens in `design-tokens.json`
3. Explore components in Storybook (after Phase 1)

### For Developers
1. Read `tasks.md` for implementation steps
2. Follow `migration-plan.md` for integration
3. Use `acceptance-checklist.md` for validation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Design tokens and Tailwind configuration
- Theme provider and utilities
- Storybook setup

### Phase 2: Core Navigation (Week 3-4)
- Navbar and Sidebar components
- Icon system
- DashboardCard component

### Phase 3: Data Components (Week 5-6)
- DataTable with virtualization
- Complete form controls
- Modal and Drawer

### Phase 4: Polish (Week 7-8)
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility audit
- Documentation completion
- Production deployment

## Technology Stack

- **React** 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** 3.3.6 for styling
- **Framer Motion** 10.16.16 for animations
- **Lucide React** 0.460.0 for icons
- **Radix UI** for accessible primitives
- **Storybook** for documentation
- **Vite** 6.3.5 for build tooling

## Key Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse Desktop: >= 80
- Lighthouse Mobile: >= 60
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3.5s
- Bundle Size: < 200KB gzip

### Accessibility Targets
- WCAG AA compliance: 100%
- Color contrast: >= 4.5:1 (normal text)
- Keyboard navigation: Complete
- Screen reader: Fully supported

### Quality Targets
- Component coverage: 100% in Storybook
- Documentation: Complete for all components
- Browser support: Latest 2 versions (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Migration Strategy

The migration uses feature flags for gradual rollout:

```typescript
const featureFlags = {
  USE_PREMIUM_NAVBAR: false,
  USE_PREMIUM_SIDEBAR: false,
  USE_PREMIUM_CARDS: false,
  USE_PREMIUM_FORMS: false,
  USE_PREMIUM_TABLE: false
};
```

This allows:
- Incremental component migration
- A/B testing in production
- Instant rollback if issues arise
- Zero downtime deployment

## Getting Started with Implementation

### Step 1: Review Requirements
```bash
# Read the requirements document
cat .kiro/specs/design-system-premium/requirements.md
```

### Step 2: Understand the Design
```bash
# Read the design document
cat .kiro/specs/design-system-premium/design.md
```

### Step 3: Start Implementation
```bash
# Open tasks file in Kiro
# Click "Start task" next to Task 1
```

### Step 4: Follow Migration Plan
```bash
# Reference migration plan during integration
cat .kiro/specs/design-system-premium/migration-plan.md
```

## Support and Resources

### Documentation
- **Storybook**: Interactive component documentation (after Phase 1)
- **Design Tokens**: `design-tokens.json` in project root
- **Tailwind Config**: `tailwind.config.premium.js`

### Communication
- **Questions**: Ask in team Slack channel
- **Issues**: Report in project issue tracker
- **Feedback**: Share in weekly design system meetings

### Training
- **Session 1**: Design tokens and theme system (1 hour)
- **Session 2**: Component library (1.5 hours)
- **Session 3**: Best practices (1 hour)

## Success Criteria

The design system is considered successful when:

✅ All components meet performance budgets
✅ WCAG AA compliance achieved
✅ 100% component coverage in Storybook
✅ Developer satisfaction >= 4/5
✅ Zero critical accessibility violations
✅ Production deployment completed
✅ Team trained and comfortable with system

## Next Steps

1. **Review this specification** with stakeholders
2. **Approve requirements** in `requirements.md`
3. **Validate design** in `design.md`
4. **Begin implementation** following `tasks.md`
5. **Track progress** using task checkboxes
6. **Deploy incrementally** per `migration-plan.md`
7. **Validate quality** with `acceptance-checklist.md`
