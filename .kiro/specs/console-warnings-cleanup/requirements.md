# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses console warnings and debug output cleanup in the React application to improve developer experience and reduce noise in the browser console during development and production.

## Glossary

- **React_Router_System**: The routing system using React Router v6 with future flag compatibility warnings
- **Framer_Motion_System**: The animation system using Framer Motion for UI transitions and animations
- **Theme_Debug_System**: The theme switching system with excessive debug logging in RecentItem and RecentSection components
- **Console_Output**: Browser developer console displaying warnings, errors, and debug information

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate React Router future flag warnings, so that the console is clean and the application is prepared for future React Router versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads, THE React_Router_System SHALL NOT display v7_startTransition future flag warnings
2. WHEN the application loads, THE React_Router_System SHALL NOT display v7_relativeSplatPath future flag warnings
3. THE React_Router_System SHALL implement future flags to maintain compatibility with React Router v7
4. THE React_Router_System SHALL maintain all existing routing functionality without breaking changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix Framer Motion AnimatePresence warnings, so that animations work correctly without console errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AnimatePresence components render, THE Framer_Motion_System SHALL NOT display "multiple children with mode wait" warnings
2. THE Framer_Motion_System SHALL configure AnimatePresence components with appropriate mode settings
3. THE Framer_Motion_System SHALL maintain smooth animation transitions without visual glitches
4. WHERE AnimatePresence is used with multiple children, THE Framer_Motion_System SHALL use appropriate animation modes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove excessive theme debug logging, so that the console output is clean and focused on actual issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Theme_Debug_System SHALL NOT log theme change messages in production builds
2. THE Theme_Debug_System SHALL provide configurable debug logging for development environments
3. WHEN theme changes occur, THE Theme_Debug_System SHALL update components without console noise
4. THE Theme_Debug_System SHALL maintain all theme switching functionality without debug output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean console output, so that I can focus on actual errors and important information during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs, THE Console_Output SHALL display only essential warnings and errors
2. THE Console_Output SHALL NOT contain repetitive debug messages from theme components
3. THE Console_Output SHALL NOT contain React Router deprecation warnings
4. THE Console_Output SHALL NOT contain Framer Motion configuration warnings
