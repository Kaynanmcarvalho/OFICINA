# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for a comprehensive premium design system for the workshop management ERP system. The design system will provide a modern, accessible, and high-fidelity interface inspired by Apple's design principles: typographic clarity, visual hierarchy, subtle depth (translucency/glass effects), polished micro-interactions, and a finished product feel. The system must deliver reusable components, design tokens, and maintain full compatibility with existing light/dark theme functionality.

## Glossary

- **Design System**: A collection of reusable components, design tokens, guidelines, and patterns that ensure visual and functional consistency across the application
- **Design Tokens**: Named entities that store visual design attributes (colors, typography, spacing, shadows) in a platform-agnostic format
- **Component Library**: A set of pre-built, tested, and documented React components ready for production use
- **Theme System**: The existing light/dark mode functionality that must be preserved and extended
- **Glass Effect**: A translucent visual effect using backdrop-filter that creates depth and layering
- **Micro-interactions**: Small, subtle animations that provide feedback and enhance user experience
- **WCAG AA**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Level AA compliance standard
- **Design Token Scale**: A systematic progression of values (e.g., 50â†’900 for colors) that provides granular control
- **Headless Components**: Unstyled, accessible components that provide functionality without visual styling
- **Bundle Size**: The compressed (gzip) file size of JavaScript/CSS assets delivered to the browser
- **Critical CSS**: The minimum CSS required to render above-the-fold content
- **Viewport Breakpoints**: Screen width thresholds where layout adapts (mobile: <480px, tablet: <768px, desktop: <1280px)
